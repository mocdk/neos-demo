# neos-demo

This is a small project demonstrating the use of Neos with simple examples. 

It will give an insight to Fluid, TypoScript and NodeTypes by creating a Neos-powered website featuring a News type and a list of contries being pulled from a [REST API](http://restcountries.eu/).

# installation

Follow the [official instructions](https://www.neos.io/develop/download.html) to get a Neos installation set up.

Set up Git to use the neos-demo repository (run in your flow directory)
```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/mocdk/neos-demo.git
git reset --hard origin/master
```

You can now go through the Neos setup as it will suggest. **Remember to use the MOC.Demo site package when it prompts you.**
